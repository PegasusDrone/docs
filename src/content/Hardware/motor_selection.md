### Motor Selection
### Considerations: 
- Future usecase (i.e. additional weight 250-300 g)
- Priority given to efficiency (for longer flight time) as opposed to power (good for racing drones)
- 50% throttle taken as nominal (used to determine AUW) and 100% as extreme  
- Note: - In my view MN 5006 KV450 suits best, hence I added two configurations, i.e. with 14 and 15 inch props

### ESC Selection
### Considerations: 
- Only difference is efficiency / finetuning options 
- Air 40A should work fine for our application

<TableWrap>

| Esc          | Price ($)        |
|--------------|------------------|
| [AIR 40A 6S ](https://store.tmotor.com/goods.php?id=368)  | 39.99*4 = 159.96 |
| [ALPHA 40A 6S ](https://store.tmotor.com/goods.php?id=580)| 69.99*4 = 279.96 |

### Propeller Selection
### Considerations: 
- 5.4mm pitch would be ideal trade off between speed and precision 
- Larger Props increased efficiency and thrust
- Due to size constraints, 15'' is max we can go
- Only difference betn Foldable and normal prop I found was better efficiency/Time of flight, but they tend to have more vibrations because of bolts they are attached to.

| Propellers      | Price ($)        |
|-----------------|------------------|
|[NS14x4.8 Prop](https://store.tmotor.com/goods.php?id=962)|$49.99*2 = 99.98|
|[NS15x5 Prop](https://store.tmotor.com/goods.php?id=1072)  |56.99*2 = 113.98|
|[FA15.2Ã—5 Prop](https://store.tmotor.com/goods.php?id=391)|109.9*2 = 219.8 |

</TableWrap>

### Battery Selection
### Considerations: 
- All motors worked best with 6S  
- Rough Calculation:  
For 5000 mah  
5000*60/1000 = 300 amp/min  
If drone consumes 4 amps per motor on an average (from first table 50% throttle); i.e. 16 amps in total (we are not considering xavier's consumption)  
300/16 (amps) = 18.75 mins time of flight (approx without safety factor)
